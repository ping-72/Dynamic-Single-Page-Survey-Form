1. The Table Option Congriguation to be made unlimited X scroll

2. Form and snackbar are to be made context elements

3. Thr final form UI - both mobile and web view

3. The Image insertion in question and options

4. Two Types of Data Entry for a Table Cell:

Simple Text/Number:
The user may simply enter a text string or a number. In this case, the value is stored and later displayed directly in the final form output without any modification.

Complex Function:
Alternatively, the user can choose to enter a complex function. This function is not just a static text but a mathematical expression that involves a dynamic input coming from a previous (parent) question.

Connecting to a Previous Question:

The function allows the user to reference the answer of a previous question (from any earlier section). For example, if the user specifies that the current cell's value depends on section3 → question2, and that question provides a numerical value.
In the function, a placeholder (for example, {input} or a similar marker) is used to denote the value coming from that previous question.
Function Example and Evaluation:

Suppose the function is defined as {input} * 2 + 6.
If the user enters 20 in section3 → question2, then during the final form preview this expression is evaluated by replacing {input} with 20, calculating 20 * 2 + 6 = 46, and then displaying 46 in the table cell.
Similarly, if the previous question’s answer is 30, the calculation becomes 30 * 2 + 6 = 66.
Implementation Considerations:

When the user is configuring the table option, the cell value may either be a simple string/number or a function (indicated by a prefix like "fn:" or another marker).
During the final form preview, the system should check if a cell contains a function. If so, it should:
Retrieve the current value from the referenced previous question.
Substitute that value into the function’s expression.
Evaluate the expression (e.g., using math.js) to produce a numeric result.
The evaluated result is then displayed in the table instead of the raw function string.
